## Arduino Core Locations

If you’re interested in digging deeper into a specific core, source files for AVR boards, which are installed by default and fairly well commented, can be found at:

```
// Windows
\Arduino\hardware\arduino\avr\cores\arduino
// macOS
/Applications/Arduino.app/Contents/Java/hardware/arduino/avr/cores/arduino
```

Whereas cores you’ve added via the Boards Manager are defined in:

```
// Windows
\users\<username>\AppData\Local\Arduino15\packages 
// macOS
/home/<username>/.arduino15/packages
```

These file types are easily opened and edited by [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or any other code text editor.
